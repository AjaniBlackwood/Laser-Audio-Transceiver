# Laser-Audio-Transceiver
The transmitter circuit was designed to take music input from a smartphone and amplify that voltage signal through a network of operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors to adequately keep noise levels low and transmit the data via laser. Volume control was implemented by using variable resistors which served the purpose of varying the current and voltage levels of the laser. Care was made to not enhance the noise too much in the process.  At the other end was the receiver portion. The laser transmission was received through a solar cell as it yielded better performance than a diode. The signal received by the cell was amplified again and further filters out noise. This was to account for losses in transmission through the air as well as filter out noise from the environment from light sources and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Different combinations of capacitors and resistors were used here to adequately filter signals. Variable resistors were also used here for quick inline tuning. We were able to amplify the signal enough and maintain adequate current in the circuit to drive the 8ohm speaker at the end of the receiver and successfully play the music.
